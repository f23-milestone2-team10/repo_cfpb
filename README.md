## What is the data?

A collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that cfpb sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.

The database generally updates daily. To make sure we are on a consistent load, recommend to download the above Google Drive hosed one, ( the one does't update daily).
